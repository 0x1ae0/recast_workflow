# Recast Workflow

Recast_workflow is a tool for creating new computation workflow for running physics analyses. The generated workflows are interpreted by the [Yadage engine](https://github.com/yadage/yadage) and are stored as .yml files. The package comes with a command line interface as while as a python package.

This is currently being developed as part of IRIS-HEP fellowship. The full proposal can be viewed [here](https://iris-hep.org/fellows/vovechkin.html). The current status of the fellowship can be read here[].
